## About

- This repository consists of all the C programming projects done with [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Full stack Software Engineering course in partnership with [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) by [akins-dev](https://github.com/akins-dev/).
- All main.c files are prewritten by the school. We build functions that produce a specific output while also taking into consideration edge cases.
- All files were written with [betty coding style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki) in mind.
---

- C is fun but its not that easy, so I have some [notes](./notes.md) that will actually show you the journey and thought process.
